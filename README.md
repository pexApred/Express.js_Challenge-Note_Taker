# Express.js_Challenge-Note_Taker

## Description

The challenge was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
